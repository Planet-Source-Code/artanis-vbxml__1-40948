## \_vbXML\_


</div>

### Description

vbXML is a class wrapper for the MSXML 2.0 Library (should also be supported by the 4.0 Library as well, since it is backwards compatible). vbXML gives users an easy to use front-end for MSXML, allowing you to easily read, write, delete, and create nodes and node attributes. You can also read in the full XML for a node (and all child nodes) or the full XML file itself. vbXML is based (almost entirely) on the CGoXML class submited to PSC, though vbXML is completely my own code. Included is a quick and dirty example to show you the basics of vbXML. Some comments or a vote would be nice =)
